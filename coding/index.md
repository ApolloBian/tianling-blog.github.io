# Coding Tips Archive
Coding is interesting stuff. In this archival page, I will put some useful codes, programming tips, algorithms that I consider either important or interesting. 

Iâ€™m a lousy programmer though. If you find some of my posts are not good as you expected, please [send me an email](mailto:bian_tianling@sjtu.edu.cn).
